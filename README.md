This is my personal Swift learning project. It downloads Apple's keynote or press media videos, given their primary `.m3u8` file.

Some of the Swift features used in this project:

- Basic control flow.
- `struct` and `class`.
  - Access control.
- Regular expression.
- Error handling (exceptions and `do` + `catch`).
- The new concurrency features introduced in Swift 5.5.
  - `async` and `await`.
  - `Task`.
  - `Sendable` protocol.
